## Data

- Wie und warum eingeschränkt (2000 onwards)
- Welche Variablen & Länder
- Hübscher Plot


## Oh what a merry regression tree

<!-- We try to split the observations into clubs akin to: -->
- Split observations into clubs:

```{r echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tree <- function(data, split_vars, end_criteria) {
  split <- find_best_split(...)
  
  if (!end_criteria) {
    return(list(tree(split$data1, ...),
                tree(split$data2, ...)))
  } else { # if(end_criteria)
    return(data)
  }
}
```

## Regression Tree

<!-- Thus we divide up our dataset based on some splitting variables and receive trees like this one: -->
- Receive a tree-structure of data:

<!-- Add pretty (?) tree, dummy ahead: -->
![](../pres1/tree.png){width=80%}

<!-- Unfortunately we have to rely on spatially filtered data for this process, as there is no theoretically well-founded way of fitting spatial models to recursive subsets. -->
- Caveat: linear model with spatially filtered data
<!-- Mention fancy distance stuff -->

## Regression Tree

- Tested with simulated and real data
- Compares well against partykit [@hothorn15]
<!-- Maybe show we did / it does -->

## Results

- Plot of clubs
- some first LM vs. SAR vs. SEM comparisons
